## Release a new version

To release a new gem version you have to be owner of the gem on rubygems.org. 
If you're not you can ask for ownership or you can build a gem locally. To build 
a gem locally, cd into staypuft directory and run `rake build`. This builds
a gem in pkg directory. The version is determined by constant in lib/staypuft/version.rb 
so if you want to bump version, modify this file before running rake.

If you are the owner and you want to release new gem version, make sure you're building
from official repository (not your own fork). Clone the repository and make sure the origin
remote is github.com/theforeman/staypuft. Now bump the version in lib/staypuft/version.rb.
Finally build and release new gem by running `rake release`. This will build the package,
tag the commit, push the commit and the tag to origin and uploads the gem to rubygems.org.

To build and RPM we recommend using our specs in [Foreman packaging](https://github.com/theforeman/foreman-packaging).
You should find the spec in rpm/develop branch. There's also a README.md which explains
how you should update and build a package. Long story short, you update the gem and spec,
send and send a PR. Once it's merged you can build in our koji instance (if you have
access) using tito.
